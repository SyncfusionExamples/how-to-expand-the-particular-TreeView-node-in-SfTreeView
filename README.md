# how-to-expand-the-particular-TreeView-node-in-SfTreeView

This repository contains a sample demonstrating how to expand the particular TreeView node in .NET MAUI TreeView (SfTreeView).

## Sample

```csharp
public class Behavior : Behavior<SfTreeView>
{
    SfTreeView treeView;
    protected override void OnAttachedTo(SfTreeView bindable)
    {
        treeView = bindable;
        treeView.Loaded += TreeView_Loaded;
        treeView.CollapseAll();
        base.OnAttachedTo(bindable);
    }
    private void TreeView_Loaded(object sender, Syncfusion.Maui.TreeView.TreeViewLoadedEventArgs e)
    {
        int TotalNodes = treeView.Nodes.Count();
        for (int i = 0; i < TotalNodes; i++)
        {
            TreeViewNode node = treeView.Nodes[i];
            var content = (node.Content as Folder).FileName;
            if (content.ToString() == "Downloads")
            {
                treeView.ExpandNode(node);
            }
        }
    }
    protected override void OnDetachingFrom(SfTreeView bindable)
    {
        treeView.Loaded -= TreeView_Loaded;
        base.OnDetachingFrom(bindable);
    }
}
```

## Requirements to run the demo
